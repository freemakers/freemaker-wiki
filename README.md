## A Wiki for the Free State Maker Society

The Free State Maker Society is a nascent maker group in Lawrence, KS. We're just getting started, but we're hoping to model the group around the early [Royal Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society#History) in England. Specifically, the notion of decentralization is central, since we're not interested in the headaches associated with creating a single workshop and addressing the liability questions that come with having all sorts of power tools in a rented space. That's not even mentioning the start-up cost of buying the standard equipment connoted by a makerspace (3D printer, CNC, etc.).

We're starting this on a shoestring without much more than passion for creating new things and some rough tools in our garages. We'll see how far the decentralized model gets us.
