#Hardware Design

![hardware design diagram](/static/images/freelab/hardware-design.png)

The hardware design basically revolves around the Raspberry Pi, model A. Other hardware pieces are only necessary to provide off-grid power for the RPi. This includes a large LiPo cell with charger and DC-DC boost converter. While it's possible to use two LiPo cells and avoid the boost converter, this drastically complicates the circuit required to charge the system. So, there is a trade-off and it's not clear which is the better approach.
